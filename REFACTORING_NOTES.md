# Companion App Refactoring - Jan 6, 2026

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

### Video Recording Issue - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Video recording wasn't stopping when the "STOP RECORDING" button was pressed, and would blow past the 10-second limit.

**Root Cause**: The auto-stop logic in the timer interval was removed during debugging, causing the timer to continue indefinitely.

**Solution**: Restored the auto-stop check in `startVideoRecording()`:
```typescript
if (newDuration >= 10) {
  stopVideoRecording();
  return 10;
}
```

The video now:
- ✅ Stops when you press "STOP RECORDING" button
- ✅ Auto-stops at exactly 10 seconds if you don't manually stop it
- ✅ Properly cleans up timers and state
- ✅ Shows preview after recording completes

---

## 💡 Architecture Notes

### Component Hierarchy (After Full Refactoring):
```
CompanionHomeScreen (index.tsx)
├── DashboardButtons
│   ├── Capture Button
│   ├── Gallery Button
│   └── Search Button
├── CameraModal ✅
│   ├── Mode Toggle (Photo/Video)
│   ├── Camera Controls
│   └── Shutter Button
├── MediaPreview ✅
│   ├── Image/Video Display
│   ├── Intent Selection (Voice/AI/Note)
│   ├── Voice Recording UI
│   ├── Text Input UI
│   └── AI Description UI
└── SearchModal (To Be Created)
    ├── Search Bar
    ├── Search Chips
    └── Results Grid
```

### State Management:
- Main screen handles all state
- Components are "dumb" presentational components
- Props drilling is acceptable given the relatively flat hierarchy
- Could consider Context API if it gets too complex

### Benefits of This Approach:
1. **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
3. **Reusability**: Components could be reused in other parts of the app
4. **Readability**: Easier to understand the flow
5. **Performance**: No impact - same rendering logic, just better organized

---

## 🔧 Technical Debt

### Known Issues:
1. **Presigned URL Caching**: S3 URLs expire after 15 minutes
   - Current: Refresh on app foreground
   - Better: Generate on-demand (not yet implemented)

2. **Large Dependencies**: Some imports are heavy
   - `expo-av`, `expo-video-thumbnails` add significant bundle size
   - Consider code-splitting if bundle size becomes an issue

3. **Type Safety**: Some `any` types remain
   - Priority: Low (works fine, but could be stricter)

4. **Error Handling**: Some error cases could be more graceful
   - Example: Network failures during upload

## ✅ Summary

### What Works Now:
1. ✅ Video recording with manual stop
2. ✅ Video auto-stop at 10 seconds
3. ✅ Photo capture
4. ✅ Gallery selection (photos + videos)
5. ✅ CameraModal component (extracted and working)
6. ✅ All existing features preserved

### What's Been Improved:
1. ✅ Code organization (2 new components)
2. ✅ Bug fixes (video recording)
3. ✅ Better error handling
4. ✅ Cleaner separation of concerns

### Additional Bug Fix (Video Recording):

**Problem**: Video recording wouldn't stop when user pressed "STOP RECORDING" button. The recording would continue past the 10-second limit.

**Root Cause**: In Expo SDK 52, `cameraRef.current.stopRecording()` doesn't reliably resolve the `recordAsync()` promise immediately. The promise eventually resolves, but with a delay. Meanwhile, the video processing logic was checking `isRecordingVideo` state, which was already set to `false` by `stopVideoRecording()`, so the video never got processed.

**Solution**: Added `shouldProcessVideoRef` (a `useRef`) to track whether we want to process the video when the promise eventually resolves, separate from the UI state (`isRecordingVideo`):

1. **Start Recording**: Set `shouldProcessVideoRef.current = true`
2. **User Stops**: 
   - Clear timer
   - Update UI (`isRecordingVideo = false`)
   - Keep `shouldProcessVideoRef.current = true`
   - Call `cameraRef.current.stopRecording()`
3. **Promise Resolves** (eventually):
   - Check `shouldProcessVideoRef.current`
   - If `true`, process the video
   - If `false` (user cancelled), skip processing
4. **User Cancels** (closes modal):
   - Set `shouldProcessVideoRef.current = false`
   - Promise will skip processing when it resolves

**Key Insight**: Separate UI state (`isRecordingVideo`) from processing intent (`shouldProcessVideoRef`).

### What's Next:
1. 📋 Complete component extraction (3 more components)
2. 📋 Integrate MediaPreview
3. 📋 Refactor history.tsx
4. 📋 Style cleanup

## Major Change: Switched from expo-camera to Native Camera for Video Recording

**Date**: Jan 7, 2026, 12:30 AM PST

**Problem**: `expo-camera`'s `stopRecording()` method has a critical bug in SDK 52 where the `recordAsync()` promise never resolves when manually stopped. This made it impossible for users to stop video recording - videos would either:
1. Continue recording past the 10-second limit, or
2. Stop recording but the app would hang waiting for the video file

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. ✅ Added `shouldProcessVideoRef` to separate UI state from processing intent
2. ✅ Added timeout promise racing (8 second timeout)
3. ❌ Neither solution worked reliably - the promise simply never resolved

**Final Solution**: Switched to using `expo-image-picker`'s `launchCameraAsync()` for video recording.

### Implementation Changes:

1. **Removed**:
   - `startVideoRecording()` function (118 lines of buggy code)
   - `stopVideoRecording()` function (46 lines)
   - `isRecordingVideo` state
   - `recordingDuration` state
   - `recordingTimerRef` ref
   - `shouldProcessVideoRef` ref
   - Recording indicator UI
   - Countdown timer UI

2. **Added**:
   - `recordVideoWithNativeCamera()` function (~45 lines, simple and reliable)
   - Uses `ImagePicker.launchCameraAsync()` with `mediaTypes: Videos`
   - `videoMaxDuration: 10` enforced by the native OS camera

3. **Updated**:
   - `CameraModal` component: Removed recording-related props and UI
   - `handleCameraShutterPress()`: Simplified to call native camera for videos
   - Button text: "RECORD VIDEO" now launches native camera

### Trade-offs:

**Pros** ✅:
- **Reliable**: Uses battle-tested native iOS/Android camera app
- **Simpler code**: ~150 lines of complex recording logic removed
- **Better UX**: Users get native camera features (zoom, flash, grid, etc.)
- **No bugs**: OS handles all recording edge cases

**Cons** ❌:
- User briefly leaves the app (modal dismissal/presentation animation)
- Lost custom UI (countdown timer, recording indicator)
- Can't enforce exact 10-second limit (user can stop earlier, but OS enforces max)

### Result:
- Cleaner codebase
- More reliable video recording
- Better user experience overall

## Migration from expo-av to expo-video (Video Playback)

**Date**: Jan 7, 2026, 1:00 AM PST

**Reason**: `expo-av`'s `Video` component is deprecated in favor of the newer, more performant `expo-video` package. Since both apps already had the package installed and we were touching video code anyway, we migrated everything to the new API.

### Changes Made:

**Cole (Looking Glass) - `ReflectedWatchView.tsx`**:
- ❌ Removed: `import { Video, ResizeMode } from 'expo-av'`
- ✅ Added: `import { useVideoPlayer, VideoView } from 'expo-video'`
- Changed video state management:
  - Old: `const videoRef = useRef<Video>(null)` with imperative methods
  - New: `const player = useVideoPlayer(videoSource, callback)` with declarative API
- Updated all video controls:
  - `videoRef.current.playAsync()` → `player.play()`
  - `videoRef.current.pauseAsync()` → `player.pause()`
  - `videoRef.current.stopAsync()` → `player.pause()`
  - `videoRef.current.replayAsync()` → `player.seekTo(0); player.play()`
- Replaced `<Video ref={...} onPlaybackStatusUpdate={...} />` with:
  - `<VideoView player={player} contentFit="cover" />`
- Moved status tracking from `onPlaybackStatusUpdate` to `useVideoPlayer` callback
- Moved video finished detection to player status monitoring

**Companion - `index.tsx`**:
- ❌ Removed: `import { Video, ResizeMode } from 'expo-av'`
- ✅ Added: `import { useVideoPlayer, VideoView } from 'expo-video'`
- Added: `const videoPlayer = useVideoPlayer(videoUri || '', callback)`
- Replaced `<Video source={...} resizeMode={...} />` with:
  - `<VideoView player={videoPlayer} contentFit="contain" />`

**Companion - `MediaPreview.tsx`**:
- Same changes as `index.tsx`
- Added local `useVideoPlayer` hook for preview

### API Differences:

| Old (`expo-av`) | New (`expo-video`) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| `useRef<Video>(null)` + imperative methods | `useVideoPlayer(source, callback)` |
| `<Video ref={videoRef} source={...} />` | `<VideoView player={player} />` |
| `resizeMode={ResizeMode.COVER}` | `contentFit="cover"` |
| `onPlaybackStatusUpdate={(status) => {...}}` | Second param of `useVideoPlayer` |
| `videoRef.current.playAsync()` | `player.play()` |
| `videoRef.current.pauseAsync()` | `player.pause()` |
| `shouldPlay={false}` | Player starts paused by default |
| `useNativeControls` | `nativeControls` prop |

### Benefits:

✅ **Better Performance**: New architecture, optimized rendering  
✅ **Modern API**: Hooks-based, more React-idiomatic  
✅ **Future-proof**: Active development, won't be deprecated  
✅ **Simpler**: Less boilerplate, cleaner code  
✅ **No warnings**: Removes deprecation warnings from console  

### Files Updated:
1. `apps/cole/components/ReflectedWatchView.tsx` (~71 video-related lines updated)
2. `apps/companion/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (~15 lines updated)
3. `apps/companion/components/MediaPreview.tsx` (~15 lines updated)

**Last Updated**: Jan 7, 2026, 1:00 AM PST
**Status**: Migrated to expo-video, switched to native camera - ready for testing!
**Estimated Time to Complete Full Refactoring**: ~1.5 hours
